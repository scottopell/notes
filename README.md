# notes
Things that I google for more than twice I try to put in here.


## vim

- Delete blank lines
  - `:g/^$/d`


## tmux

- renumber all windows (`1 | 2 | 4 | 6` -> `1 | 2 | 3 | 4` )
  - `movew -r`
  - 

## sed

- print out certain lines from file
  - `sed -n '5320,5340p' ~/drjava/src/edu/rice/cs/drjava/ui/MainFrame.java`
